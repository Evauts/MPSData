I am writing on behalf of Ms. Sharon De Silva, who currently resides in a rental flat under your jurisdiction, to request a waiver of part of the conservancy and service charges and to propose a payment plan for the remaining balance.

Ms. De Silva has been facing a series of financial and health challenges which have significantly impacted her ability to meet her financial obligations. She is the primary caregiver for her three young children, aged 9, 7, and almost 4, and manages her health issues, including a heart condition that necessitates regular medical attention and hospital visits. These circumstances have strained her financial resources, further exacerbated by her husband's fluctuating employment - who earns around $2,000 per month as the family's sole breadwinner and who also supports his family members in Malaysia.

Ms. De Silva has demonstrated her intention to resolve her debts by paying half of the outstanding amount, $565.50, to avoid legal proceedings. She proposes to settle the remaining balance through manageable instalments. Given her circumstances, including her limited income and substantial family and health responsibilities, we kindly request that the Town Council consider withdrawing any ongoing charges against her based on this proposal.

Please consider Ms. De Silva's request sympathetically and contact her directly to discuss a feasible payment plan. Your understanding and cooperation in this matter would greatly alleviate the pressures she is facing and contribute positively to her efforts to provide a stable environment for her family.

Thank you for considering this request. We look forward to your favourable response.",Pending,,N,N,N,

This happened just before the red light junction of Holland Road and Buona Vista junction causing the camera to be triggered. He was a sitting duck in the car and he had to steer the car to the left away from other motorists until he got to the Esso station around 50m ahead. 

He then called a tow truck and as soon as he got to the workshop, he downloaded the car’s diagnostics to use as evidence for his case (appended). He also includes the invoice of the cost incurred in repairing the transmission (faulty part) and the payment receipt of his client. 

In this case, he was a sitting duck and was at the mercy of the car’s ‘fault mode’ as it crossed the traffic light junction. There was neither intention nor malice on his part and he feels that this summon, with fine ($400) and demerit points (12 points) is unfair.

Letter of appeal to HDB:

My resident, Ms Tammy Tan, would like to expedite their HDB rental application reference number 66618e69293e012f9de6ff59.

On 6 June 2024, Ms Tammy and her husband, Toh Jia Xi Edwin, applied to HDB for a rental flat under the Public Rental Scheme. The couple just got married on 27 May 2024, and due to family issues on both ends, they are currently living seperately at their individual homes.

Ms Tammy's family lives at Bayshore, and has faced complicated parent's marital issues in the past which has resulted in police reports. She has anxiety issues in the past 4 years, and seek help in 2022. She has recovered recently. She is able to provide letters from her Family Service Centre at Bedok and psychiatrist to support her condition upon request. Living with her family might trigger her mental health condition, which is undesirable.

Currently, her husband, Mr Toh is staying at his uncle's place at Geylang. As a newly married couple, it is inconvenient for them to stay with his relatives and it is stressful mentally and physically for the both of them.

With Ms Tan studying earning $450-500 from her part-time job as a clinic assistant and Mr Toh earning around $2300 per month as a Police Officer, it is hard for them to purchase a resale flat/rent a private room. They are looking forward to rent the HDB flat urgently to ease their mental and physical stress and to apply for a BTO flat in October 2024 to start their family.

on the transition back to school and to the new class. 3. We agreed during the
meeting that a change of schools at this point may not be the most beneficial
for Zen Yum as the new school would not be familiar with his needs. As Zen Yum
has shown a positive response to being back in school in Springfield Secondary,
it might be more beneficial for us to work together and persist in our efforts
to transit him back to attending school fully and being focused on moving
forward. We want to assure you that the school remains dedicated to supporting
Zen Yum and we are optimistic that with the support systems in place, Zen Yum
will successfully reintegrate into Springfield indue course. 4. We thank you for
your partnership and do feel free to reach out to the school or to me directly

She is requesting to expedite her appeal against the rejection of her previous request to rent out one of the bedrooms in her house at New Upper Changi Road Block 28. The rental serves to be her only form of income to cover her daily expenses and necessities.

As mentioned in the previous letter, her application to rent out the bedrooms was rejected by HDB’s Ms Peggy Lim as Mr Poh Lye Huat, the administrator of their late mother, Mdm Cheonh Ah Kiat’s share of the home, has yet to transfer his late mother’s shares to his siblings. 

She is seeking an exception to the above mentioned rule to allow her to rent out the bedroom despite the lease not being in order. This is because of her estranged adopted son,  who has had a history of trying to sell off her property without her consent. The administrator, Mr Poh, is unwilling to transfer their late mother’s shares, as they are worried that the share, or the proceeds of the sale, may end up in his hands. They are also unable to sell the flat now as suggested by HDB as Mdm Poh and her helper are staying in the flat. 

As such, she is hoping that HDB is able to provide her an exception to this rule, and allow her to rent out one of the bedrooms in her home.

He is currently serving as a storeman in Supply Base East due to the injury but he feels he could not carry out his duties meaningfully due to the severe injury and becomes more of a liability to his army colleagues.

He has applied for disruption sometime in April 2024 under the LMDS but he was not informed of the outcome.  He then applied the second time in early May 2024.

His father, Dr Rodney is appealing on behalf of Ryan for MINDEF to grant him the deferment so that he can continue with his medical studies in NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.  He feels that his son was injured in service and feels that MINDEF should not use the reason that he has not finished his BMT to deny him the deferment for his medical studies.

Ryan is confident that if given the deferment to continue his studies now, he is able to come back to serve his National Service more fruitfully and meaningfully after he completes his studies in the future.

Despite being an A level student and excelling in counselling, she is finding it difficult to secure employment; and counselling jobs offer salaries only between $2000-$3000 which is not sufficient to sustain a living in Singapore,

She was delighted to hear about the $4000 Skills Development Fund for Singaporeans aged 40 and above, but she is disappointed to learn that she could not use it to pay for her PGDC.

She would like to pursue her Master’s degree to improve her employability, but the cost is prohibitive. She is seeking to use her Skills Development Fund to help cover the expenses. 

Her financial situation is constrained, and she is reluctant to use her husband’s dwindling CPF savings, especially as he is now retired.

Therefore, she is  hoping to utilize her CPF (OA) and SDF to cover the expenses for her Master’s programme.

She and her boyfriend are concerned about the affordability of their BTO flat due to the income assessment on their HFE letter and high initial financial burden.

They applied for their BTO flat in October 2023 and successfully selected a unit in March 2024.

Unfortunately, at the time of applying for the HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter in July 2023, she was still a final year university student. As such, her  income was not being considered for the current HFE loan amount.

Based on the current HFE loan amount, they are concerned that the first downpayment and the balance payment will be a significant financial burden for them especially since they will also be repaying their  university loans.

A deferred income assessment would allow for their future income to be considered closer to the flat completion date, providing a more accurate reflection of their combined financial standing. 

This would potentially increase their HDB loan amount and make the balance payment more manageable.

The recently announced lowered first downpayment of 2.5% would significantly reduces the initial financial burden.  This, combined with a deferred income assessment, would make homeownership a much more attainable goal for them.

Mdm Lim was charged for mosquito breeding (NEA-0046965-23) on 24/05/24 as water accumulated in her flower pot despite her putting a plastic bag on it. Mdm Lim used a plastic bag to cover the soil on her flowerpot to prevent excess stagnant water from accumulating, however during the rainy season the water seeped through holes in the plastic bag resulting in stagnant water accumulation. Mdm Lim hadn’t realised that there would be holes in the bag and hence did not clear the pot of its water.

Dear DPM

We refer to your MPAS letter of 5 June 2024 (Reference: 014-2406040701) regarding Mr Chia Kee Kok’s re-appeal for higher nursing home subsidies for his sister, Mdm Chia Kah Hio.

We first spoke with Mr Chia on 19 April 2024 (Reference: 014-2404150116) on the same request and Mr Chia had noted then the Tampines Care Home’s Medical Social Worker (MSW), Ms Siti Faseha was assisting him in the matter. Ms Siti Faseha would also reach out to Mr Chia to explore other possible options for financial assistance regarding his sister’s nursing home fees, if applicable.

From this latest referral, we spoke with Mr Chia on 7 June 2024 to better understand the latest situation. We note that the Tampines Care Home’s MSW, Ms Nivetha D/O Anand Pereira is currently in the midst of assisting Mr Chia on this request, after we highlighted Mr Chia’s request to the nursing home for their noting. Ms Nivetha subsequently informed that she will follow up directly with Mr Chia on the outcome of his appeal.

Please be assured that Mr Chia’s request is continuing to receive our attention. We will work closely with the nursing home’s MSW and Mr Chia to provide his sister with the necessary support. Mr Chia is aware of our contact details for him to reach us if he needs further assistance.
